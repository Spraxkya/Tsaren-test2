# World Map – Dalarna Region

## Region Inspiration
The region is inspired by **Dalarna, Sweden**, using real geography as the
foundation for towns, routes, traversal, and progression.

Design principles:
- Geography-first world design
- High player freedom without sequence breaking
- HMs used for exploration, not mandatory progression
- Strong sense of journey, return, and mastery

---

## Overall World Structure

**Mountain Origin → Southern Hub → Siljan Loop → Return → Final Ascent**

1. Mountain starting village (early, incomplete access)
2. Southern Dalarna hub (open gym order)
3. Siljan region loop (midgame exploration)
4. Return to Borlänge via Dalälven
5. Final mountain ascent to endgame valley

---

## Starting Area – Mountain Village

- Small village located on a mountain
- Elevation is high, but clearly not the highest point
- Visible cliffs and blocked paths foreshadow later progression
- Player initially travels *downward* toward civilization

Purpose:
- Establish verticality early
- Create long-term environmental payoff
- Set up the final return climb later in the game

---

## Southern Dalarna – Hub Region

### Central Hub
**Borlänge** functions as:
- Infrastructure hub
- Travel nexus
- Narrative anchor (return point later)

Borlänge does **not** contain an early gym.

---

### Southern Gym Section (Any Order – 4 Gyms)

The following gyms can be completed in **any order**:

- Ludvika
- Avesta
- Säter
- Falun

Rules:
- No HM is required to reach any of these cities
- All cities are reachable on foot via interconnected routes
- After first visiting a city, **train travel** becomes available
- Trains allow fast travel between southern cities

Design intent:
- Maximum early freedom
- No forced backtracking
- Travel convenience without progression gating

---

### HM Philosophy (Southern Section)

The player unlocks the following HMs during this section:

- Cut
- Rock Smash
- Strength
- Fly

Rules:
- None of these HMs are required for story progression
- They unlock shortcuts, optional routes, and secrets
- Fly and trains ensure smooth navigation without frustration

---

## Transition to Siljan Region

After completing the southern gyms, the player progresses north via a
distinct route from **Falun to Rättvik**.

This transition marks a clear shift into the midgame.

---

## Siljan Region – Midgame Loop

### Core Siljan Gyms (Any Order – 3 Gyms)

The following gyms can be completed in **any order**:

- Rättvik
- Leksand
- Mora

Traversal rules:
- No trains are available between Siljan cities
- Travel is done via:
  - foot
  - boat
  - Fly (after first visit)

Design intent:
- Slower, scenic exploration
- Strong regional identity
- Encourages route familiarity

---

### Optional Area – Sollerön

- Reachable via Surf
- Contains a special challenge
- Completing the challenge unlocks **Mega Evolution**

Rules:
- Not required for main progression
- Designed as a test of skill
- Rewards mastery and exploration

---

## Surf & Dalälven Progression

### Surf Unlock
- Surf is obtained after defeating the **5th gym**
- Immediately useful around Lake Siljan
- Enables access to Sollerön and water shortcuts

### Dalälven Block
- Dalälven river is initially blocked (e.g. by Bidoof / natural obstruction)
- Player can see the route but cannot use it yet
- Block is removed after defeating the **7th gym**

### Return Route
- Dalälven provides a long Surf route
- Leads back to **Borlänge**
- Serves as a natural return path rather than teleportation

---

## Final Gym – Borlänge

- Final gym is located in Borlänge
- Challenged after returning via Dalälven

Design intent:
- Narrative and emotional payoff
- “Return home” after mastering the region
- Unlocks access to the final area

---

## Rock Climb & Final Ascent

### Rock Climb Unlock
- Obtained in Borlänge after the final gym
- Enables traversal of previously unreachable cliffs

### Mountain Route
- Rock Climb opens a new route from the **starting mountain village**
- Leads upward via a red-marked path
- Connects to a large, high-altitude valley

This recontextualizes the starting area as incomplete rather than small.

---

## Endgame – Northern Valley

- Large mountain valley region
- Harsh terrain, wilderness, snow
- Home to the strongest trainers in the region

Endgame structure:
- Trainers are spread throughout the valley
- Order is flexible
- Final Champion resides at the deepest / highest point

This may function as:
- A traditional Elite Four structure
- Or a hunt for the region’s strongest trainers

Final structure to be decided later.

---

## Traversal Philosophy

- Backtracking is encouraged
- Geography dictates progression more than story flags
- HMs enhance exploration rather than unlock progression
- World is interconnected and looped, not linear

---

## Notes for Implementation

- Gym difficulty scales based on completion order within each section
- HM unlocks are communicated via NPCs and environmental cues
- Major routes are visible before they are accessible to build anticipation
