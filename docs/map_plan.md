# Map Plan – Dalarna Region

## Elevation Layers
- Lowlands (south): industry, trains, old gyms
- Mid elevation: forests, lakes, Siljan region
- High elevation: mountain routes, valley, endgame

## Transport Systems
- Trains: southern cities only (unlocked by visiting city once)
- Boats: Siljan region (after Surf)
- Fly: after southern gym completion
